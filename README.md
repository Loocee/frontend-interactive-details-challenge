Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


### Continued development

I'd like to work and improve my media query for various devices and make this project responsive for all devices.


### Useful resources

I'd recommend stack overflow for asking questions when you get confused.
